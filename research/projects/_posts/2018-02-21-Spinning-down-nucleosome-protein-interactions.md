##  Research Description

Nucleosomes are the gatekeepers to the genome. 
They serve as a binding platform for hundreds of proteins to regulate processes such as gene expression and DNA repair.

Knowlegde of how these proteins recognize and bind to nucleosome is key to our fundamental understanding of this fundamental layer in biology.

Even more such this is crucial to guide rational efforts in the search for new drugs and therapeutic approaches.
We use NMR spectroscopy to decipher the structural basis of nucleosome-protein interactions and recently expanded out toolbox with a new approach relying on sedimented nucleosomes and solid-state NMR.
