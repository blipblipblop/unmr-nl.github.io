## Take a tour of these exciting featured uNMR-NL [projects](/research/projects)

### Research areas within uNMR-NL

The development of molecular sciences for materials, food and health critically depends on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

The versatility of Magnetic Resonance to characterize equally well all kinds of materials, biomolecules, processes and living organisms makes NMR an indispensable tool to find solutions for major problems that our society faces.

As a non-invasive method, modern NMR represents one out of very few widely applied analytical methods that grows with the development of sciences and has continuously found new and abundant application in virtually all research fields in biology, chemistry, physics and medicine.

### Technology development
Development of sophisticated probes and pulse sequences, hyphenation with other techniques and dedicated sample preparation methods. 

### Life-sciences
Atomic detailed information on biomolecular structures and their complexes to understand biomolecular (mal)functioning in cells.

### Health
Development of high-field MRI as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. Characterisation and molecular interaction of novel drugs or drug delivery systems. 

### Nutrition
Microstructure characterization of foods to optimize industrial processing and enhance quality concerning health and texture. Quantitative metabolic profiling of body fluids to study dietary effects.

### Chemistry & Materials
Functional characterisation of materials, such as efficient catalysts or high-performance plastics. Monitoring and characterisation of chemical reactions and their mechanism.

###  New energy
Unraveling the molecular basics of energy regulation and storage in intact plants and algae and characterisation of novel materials for the generation and storage of energy.

### uNMR Video
This video produced to celebrate the opening of the uNMR-NL facility nicely illustrates the wide field of applications for NMR.
