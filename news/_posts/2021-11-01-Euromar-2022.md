On behalf of the Scientific Committees of the EUROMAR and AMPERE organisations, we are delighted to welcome you to EUROMAR 2022 in Utrecht, The Netherlands!

Our meeting is scheduled to take place on 10-14 July 2022. Together with our partners, we will provide a stimulating forum to exchange on the most recent breakthroughs in magnetic resonance and to showcase the latest developments of our industrial sponsors. After two virtual meetings, our mission is to organize a fully live event but our preparations also include backup options (online or hybrid). Stay tuned to this web site for latest information.
