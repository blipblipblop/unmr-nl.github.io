Researchers in Utrecht have found a new way to observe membraneless compartments at an unprecedented level of resolution. The existence of these so called biomolecular condensates in the cell contradicts every textbook on the subject. This is the first time that they have been observed in the test tube with a high degree of precision. The researchers and their colleagues in Germany will publish their findings in Nature Communications on 4 October 2019.
