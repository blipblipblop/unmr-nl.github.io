A new paramagnetic probe has been synthesized and applied to proteins. The probe consists of a cobalt or manganese ion packed in a cage that can be linked to specific sites on a protein via two arms to make it very rigid. These probes will be used to characterize the structure and function of enzymes and other proteins in detail. The research was performed by the CSC-funded student Qing Miao and the master student Thomas Kock under the guidance of Dr. Mark Overhand and Prof. Marcellus Ubbink in the Leiden Institute of Chemistry and was published in Angewandte Chemie
