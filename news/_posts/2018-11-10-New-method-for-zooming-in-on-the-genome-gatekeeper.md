Researchers at Utrecht University have developed a widely applicable method to obtain insight into the interactions between proteins and chromatin at the atomic level. This is the complex of DNA and proteins in the cell that regulates everything pertaining to DNA, both during the development of the cell and over the course of its life. The method is new in that it also provides insight into the effects of the interaction on the local motions of the protein and the chromatin. “We still don’t know much about how this fundamental layer of biology works, because it is such a complex system”, according to Utrecht University research leader Dr. Hugo van Ingen. The method was published in the scientific journal Angewandte Chemie.
