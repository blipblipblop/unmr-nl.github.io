On Monday October 9th we will organize a minisyposium on nuclear hyperpolarization in the solution state. Everyone with an interest in NMR methodology is welcome to attend. We would particularly like to encourage all members of uNMR-NL/NMARRS consortium to join. We will have two speakers who will discuss progress in the field and the latest research results. We hope to have lively discussions at the end of the lecture particularly involving PhD students and postdocs.

### Where:
The symposium will start at 14.00 at the Faculty of Science, Huygensbuilding, Heyendaalseweg 135 Nijmegen, room Hg00.023.
