Genetics does not tell the whole story. Epigenetics play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression and DNA repair by installing specific chemical marks on the chromatin fibre that contains our genome. For example, proper DNA repair relies on the attachment of a small ubiquitin protein to a selective site on histone H2A in chromatin. Reseachers from the groups of Hugo van Ingen (NMR Group, Bijvoet Center) and Titia Sixma (Netherlands Cancer Institute) show in a publication in Nature Communications how this site is selected.
