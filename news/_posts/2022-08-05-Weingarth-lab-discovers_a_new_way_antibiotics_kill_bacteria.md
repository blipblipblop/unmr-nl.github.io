The [Weingarth lab](https://www.weingarth-group.org/) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl) discovered a new mechanism of how antibiotics kill bacteria. The antibiotic teixobactin uses a dual molecular strategy: it blocks the bacterial cell wall synthesis and destructs the cell membrane, the researchers write in the scientific journal Nature. The new insights could enable the design of powerful antibiotics against which bacteria do not readily develop resistance.

"Bacteria need a special lipid called lipid II to build their protective envelope around them. We show at atomic level that teixobactin targets and sequesters lipid II. Afterwards, teixobactin and lipid II together form long fibrils on bacterial cell membranes," says Markus Weingarth. "Gradually, this creates a kind of valley in the landscape of the cell membrane, which then breaks down and damages the membrane." The Utrecht researchers turned out to have found a biomolecular mechanism that was unknown to science until now. "It is a unique killing strategy."
