Membrane proteins are the gatekeepers of biological cells and control a great variety of tasks that are essential for cellular homeostasis, and they are involved in virtually any signalling cascade. In the recent years, more and more evidence has emerged that certain membrane proteins organise in large clusters to fulfil their functions.

Together with his colleagues, Dr. Markus Weingarth from Utrecht University has developed a combined experimental and computational approach to study the organisation of membrane protein clusters in physiological conditions. In particular, the collection of experimental data on membrane protein clusters was enabled by using Dynamic Nuclear Polarization, a cutting-edge technique that can drastically enhance solid-state NMR sensitivity.
