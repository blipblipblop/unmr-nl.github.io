A team of researchers within the uNMR-NL consortium has explored the potential of MRI at an unprecedented high field strength. At the state-of-the-art 22.3 T NMR spectrometer of uNMR-NL consortium the team researched how to perform an MRI experiment on one of the highest magnetic fields strength worldwide. The researchers dived into the question how to ensure that other researchers can easily use this state-of-the art equipment for their own experiments.

Higher field strength for MRI are useful as images with a very high spatial resolution can be obtained. Using this unique NMR/MRI apparatus, operating at one of the highest field strength worldwide, researchers have explored the potential of MRI and localized spectroscopy for diverse biological specimen, such as plant roots.

In addition, they implemented custom-built microcoils, which can additionally enhance the sensitivity of the MRI measurement. The team has published their method, especially including the sample preparation and the calibration of the custom-built microcoils, in a video format called Journal of Visualized Experiments. Using this video instruction and corresponding protocol, a new user can use it as a guideline on how to use home-built and dedicated microcoils on this system.
