Two researchers from Utrecht University and one from the Hubrecht Institute have been awarded an ERC Consolidator Grant. The grant from the European Union enables researchers to further extend their scientific endeavour and consists on an average 2 million euro. The laureates at Utrecht University are Tobias Stark (Faculty of Social Sciences) and Markus Weingarth (Faculty of Science). The Hubrecht Instituteâ€™s laureate is Marvin Tanenbaum.

Markus Weingarth, associate Professor of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), aims to investigate how antibiotics target certain lipid molecules -fats- that only exist in bacteria, but not in human cells. Using NMR techniques, this will enable him to study the killing mechanisms of antibiotics in bacterial cells at the resolution of individual atoms.
