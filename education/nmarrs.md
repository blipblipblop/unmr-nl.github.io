## Netherlands' Magnetic Resonance School

The Netherlands’ magnetic resonance graduate school (NMARRS) is a joint educational and research initiative of four major centres for magnetic resonance research (RU, UU, UL, WU) forming one unified consortium. The school is crafted around the ultra-high field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance facility for the Netherlands (uNMR-NL) which is one of the best equipped NMR facilities in the world. NMR spectroscopy is one of the most information-rich spectroscopic methods and has widespread application in fundamental and applied research in chemistry, biology, medicine, materials and food sciences.

The Netherlands’ magnetic resonance graduate school (NMARRS) is a joint educational and research initiative of four major centres for magnetic resonance research (RU, UU, UL, WU) forming one unified consortium. The school is crafted around the ultra-high field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance facility for the Netherlands (uNMR-NL) which is one of the best equipped NMR facilities in the world. NMR spectroscopy is one of the most information-rich spectroscopic methods and has widespread application in fundamental and applied research in chemistry, biology, medicine, materials and food sciences.

The versatility of NMR derives from both the sensitivity of the nuclear spin toward its local environment, as well as the ability of the experimenter to manipulate nuclear angular momentum in elaborate ways to obtain optimal spectroscopy and imaging. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and Imaging (MRI) exploit these magnetic properties of atoms. NMR is applied to understand the causes of disease and to discover new medicines, to develop new battery and solar cell materials and to improve crop production and food quality.

The Netherlands has always been one of the leading countries in the field of NMR technology, with several excellent NMR research groups throughout the country. Maintaining this position requires access to the most advanced technology combined with a continuous training of new generations of magnetic resonance experts that can drive the development of the field forward. Therefore, NMARRS offers advanced magnetic resonance education by experts in the field and a chance to define one’s own research project; Students who enter will follow various magnetic resonance courses in their MSc programme and write and submit a PhD proposal, supported by their chosen supervisor for evaluation by the NMARRS board. The best proposals will be granted a PhD position.
